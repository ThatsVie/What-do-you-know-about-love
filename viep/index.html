                  <strong>Lumigram</strong> is a fully functional Instagram-like
                  clone built with React Native (Expo) and Firebase, developed
                  in two parts. Part 1 focused on building the frontend UI and
                  navigation using React Native, while Part 2 integrated
                  Firebase as the backend, enabling authentication, database
                  management, and real-time updates. The app allows users to
                  create, engage with, and manage posts in a seamless, intuitive
                  interface. Key features include authentication, infinite
                  scrolling, favorites, post deletion, and profile search, as
                  well as gesture-based interactions such as long press to
                  reveal captions and double tap to favorite posts. Lumigram
                  also provides a visually engaging profile system, where users
                  can customize their display picture and username. The project
                  showcases optimized state management, Firestore queries, and a
                  refined user experience with animations and haptic feedback.

                  following a structured three-phase development process. The
                  application started with styling, evolved with
                  TypeScript-based interactivity, and was refined through
                  extensive unit testing and continuous integration. The project
                  includes API-driven playlist management, playback controls,
                  speed toggling, and accessibility features. Testing was
                  implemented using Vitest, Testing Library, and Mock Service
                  Worker (MSW), with GitHub Actions automating test execution
                  and coverage reporting.

                  <strong>Atlas Cinema Guru</strong> is a full-stack, IMDb-like
                  movie application developed to practice building interactive,
                  data-driven applications. The platform allows users to browse
                  movies, filter by genre and year, favorite movies, and add
                  them to a watch later list. A dynamic activity feed tracks
                  user interactions in real-time. <br /><br />
                  Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, the project
                  integrates GitHub OAuth authentication and PostgreSQL database
                  management. It features responsive UI components, pagination,
                  and an optimized API for seamless user experience. The sidebar
                  includes an expanding navigation menu with quick access to
                  favorites, watch later, and latest activity. Deployed on
                  Vercel, the application maintains authentication state and
                  movie interactions across sessions.
