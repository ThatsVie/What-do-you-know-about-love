              I’ve heard it said that grief is just love with no place to go, and I deeply believe this. My sister Patrisia died when we were teenagers, and for a long time, I coped with that grief by causing myself harm. I felt lost, overwhelmed by a love that had no direction. I now know that healing lies in continuing to cultivate love and giving it a place to go.

              After she died, I felt immense guilt because I had been performing CPR until the ambulance arrived, and it didn’t feel like enough. Now, I understand her legacy is not defined by that moment but by the love she shared and the lives she inspires. Thank you for helping me keep her memory alive and allowing her love to find new places to grow.

      <h2 class="text-center text-white mb-4 romanceText">AI and Imagery</h2>
      <p>
        In developing <span class="romanceText">What Do You Know About Love?</span>, I’ve chosen to use AI-generated images to visually complement the deeply human stories shared. This choice carries a deliberate commentary: AI, a tool incapable of feeling or understanding love, is being used to amplify narratives rich in emotion, vulnerability, and connection. This juxtaposition between the mechanics of AI and the depth of human experience mirrors the broader intersection of technology and humanity in today’s world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve engaged with DALL-E to explore its potential as a novel tool, understanding both its capabilities and its limitations. I am aware of the ethical concerns, particularly regarding the impact on artists and the broader implications of AI. This project’s simplicity, sharing stories about love, exists alongside the complexity of the tools I use. This reflects the nature of love itself, where ideals and practical realities may not always align.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology is an integral part of how love is experienced today, from dating apps to social media and virtual relationships. By using AI, I acknowledge the reality that love and technology frequently coexist in the modern world. While AI-generated images are currently part of this project, I remain committed to exploring more ethical and meaningful ways to represent these stories as resources increase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Transparency is key. Just as contributors openly share their stories, I aim to be clear about the choices I make. The tensions within this project reflect the complexities of humanity and love. Thank you for your support as I continue navigating these choices with the goal of celebrating love in all its forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        With love,
      </p>

                <p class="text-center">
                  This project started as a school assignment to build a custom front end from scratch, but it quickly grew into something much deeper. Love, in all its forms, has always been a central theme in my life and finds its way into everything I create. My sister, Patrisia, was a significant inspiration. Her life embodied love through care, justice, and vulnerability. Her memory reminds me of love’s transformative power and the importance of sharing it.

                <p class="text-center">
                  Entering the tech industry as an artist brought new questions about creativity and innovation. Using AI-generated images in this project reflects the intersection of technology and humanity, exploring the tension between art and automation. While AI cannot feel or understand love, it serves as a tool to amplify deeply human stories, reflecting the complexity and contradictions of love itself.

                <p class="text-center">
                  This platform exists to celebrate love in all its forms, its joys, challenges, and transformative power, while encouraging people from all walks of life to share their experiences. Thank you for being part of this journey.
