              I’ve heard it said that grief is just love with no place to go, and I deeply believe this. My sister Patrisia died when we were teenagers, and for a long time, I coped with that immense grief by causing myself harm. I felt lost, overwhelmed by a love that had no direction. I now know that healing lies in continuing to cultivate love and giving it a place to go.

              After she died, I felt immense guilt because I had been performing CPR until the ambulance arrived, and it didn’t feel like enough. Now, I understand her legacy is not defined by that moment but by the love she shared and the lives she inspires. Thank you for helping me keep her memory alive and allowing her love to find new places to grow.

                </h3>
                <p class="text-center">This project began as a school assignment where the specific task was to create a custom front end from scratch. Love is always on my mind, and I apply it to all I do, including my projects. Over the trimester, each assignment inspired the idea further. A Bootstrap design project led to a pug love-themed page, and a local storage and cookies project resulted in a love journal. These assignments made me think about the simplicity and complexity of love, the consequences of its absence, and the various forms it takes.

                  A significant inspiration for this project was my sister Patrisia. She exemplified love through her deep care for others, her commitment to justice, her authenticity, and her willingness to be vulnerable. Her life and legacy remind me of love’s immense power and the importance of sharing it.
                  I wanted to create a platform that could make the world a little better by creating an archive of love and inviting people from all walks of life to share their experiences. The power of love is immense, and this project aims to explore and celebrate that higher power.</p>

These include expanding our presence on social media to reach a wider audience, launching a podcast to interview people about various love themes and share their stories, and collaborating with artists to create original content.
