              I’ve heard it said that grief is just love with no place to go, and I deeply believe this. My sister Patrisia died when we were teenagers, and for a long time, I coped with that grief by causing myself harm. I felt lost, overwhelmed by a love that had no direction. I now know that healing is found in continuing to cultivate love, giving it new places to go and ways to grow.

              After she died, I carried a heavy guilt, believing that performing CPR until the ambulance arrived wasn’t enough. But love is never measured by a single moment. Her legacy is not in how she left, but in how she lived: the kindness she showed, the connections she nurtured, and the love she shared. This project is one way I honor that love, ensuring it continues to expand, reaching places and people it was always meant to find.

      <h2 class="text-center text-white mb-4 romanceText">AI and Imagery</h2>
      <p>
        Love is felt and lived, while AI is processed and generated. <span class="romanceText">What Do You Know About Love?</span> challenges this contrast, using AI to provoke reflection on meaning and perception. If an AI-generated image accompanies a deeply human reflection on love, does it enhance or diminish the authenticity of that experience? This project does not claim to provide answers but instead encourages audiences to examine their own assumptions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        AI-generated images in this project serve as both an artistic tool and a conceptual challenge. AI does not feel love, yet it can be used to visually represent narratives that are rich in emotion, vulnerability, and connection. This contrast mirrors the broader tension between technology and human experience, between automation and emotion, between what is created and what is felt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many contributors embrace this project’s mission without concern for AI’s involvement, valuing the opportunity to share and explore love in its many forms. Others have expressed ethical reservations, questioning whether AI-generated visuals alter emotional perception or diminish artistic authenticity. This divide underscores the very questions the project seeks to examine: Can AI serve as a meaningful tool in discussions of love, or does its presence inevitably reshape how we experience emotion?
      </p>
      <p>
        I use DALL-E as a tool, recognizing both its possibilities and its limitations. AI-generated imagery in this project is not meant to replace human creativity but to explore how technology interacts with storytelling. Research suggests AI-generated responses can enhance feelings of being "heard," yet awareness of AI involvement may shift perceptions of authenticity and emotional trust. This parallels our exploration of whether AI-generated imagery enhances or disrupts the emotional depth of human stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Love and technology already coexist in many ways, from digital communication to social media and virtual relationships. This project acknowledges that reality while also questioning how tools like AI shape our perceptions of love, identity, and emotional truth. Rather than treating AI as either an unquestioned innovation or an existential threat, <span class="romanceText">What Do You Know About Love?</span> invites audiences to engage with the tension it creates, to consider both the possibilities and the ethical dilemmas, and to reflect on what it means to express love in an increasingly digital world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Transparency is key. Just as contributors openly share their stories, I remain clear about my choices. This project is an ongoing exploration, shaped by curiosity, care, and a deep respect for the stories people choose to share. Thank you for being part of this journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        With love,

                <p class="text-center">
                  This project began as a school assignment, a challenge to build a fully custom website from scratch.  
                  But as I built it, I realized it could become something much larger; a space for love, reflection, and community building.
                </p>
                <p class="text-center">
                  My sister, Patrisia, was a major inspiration. Her life embodied love through care, justice, and vulnerability.  
                  Her memory reminds me of love’s transformative power and the importance of sharing it.
                </p>
                <p class="text-center">
                  Entering the tech industry as an artist led me to explore creativity in new ways.  
                  Using AI-generated images in this project reflects the intersection of technology and humanity,  
                  exploring the tension between art and automation. While AI cannot feel or understand love,  
                  it serves as a tool to amplify deeply human stories, reflecting the complexity and contradictions of love itself.
