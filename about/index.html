              I’ve heard it said that grief is love with nowhere to go, and I believe it deeply. My sister Patrisia died when we were teenagers, and for a long time, my way of coping with that immense grief was to cause myself harm. I felt lost, overwhelmed by a love that had no direction.

Now, I understand that the answer lies in continuing to cultivate love and giving that love a place to go. Patrisia taught me so much about love: how to care deeply for those we cherish, stand up for the rights of others, be authentic, and embrace vulnerability. She experienced profound suffering, but she also knew immense joy. Patrisia was loved deeply by many and continues to be.

When she passed away from asthma, we donated her organs. Through her donation, Patrisia continues to live on in every loving action and the lives she extended. Her love and spirit resonate through the lives she touched, extending far beyond her time with us.

When she died, I felt immense guilt because I was rendering first aid until the ambulance arrived, and it didn’t feel like enough. Today, I understand that her legacy is not defined by that moment but by the love she gave and the lives she continues to inspire.

Thank you for helping me keep her memory alive and for allowing her love to continue to find new places to grow.

                <p class="text-center">A Google Form is used for this project because it is reliable and efficient. While exploring other options, I faced challenges in securing the endpoints and database. The built-in security features of Google Forms protect data and prevent spam, ensuring the integrity of the responses. The form seamlessly integrates with Google Sheets for easy data storage and analysis. It is free to use with generous limits suitable for our current needs. The ease of use for participants was a significant consideration. Other options required users to authenticate their email or create a login, which deterred some participants. As the project scales and expands, other options will be considered to better accommodate increased requirements and potentially offer more features on the site.</p>

                </h3>
                <p class="text-center">This project began as a school assignment where the specific task was to create a custom front end from scratch. Love is always on my mind, and I apply it to all I do, including my projects. Over the trimester, each assignment inspired the idea further. A Bootstrap design project led to a pug love-themed page, and a local storage and cookies project resulted in a love journal. These assignments made me think about the simplicity and complexity of love, the consequences of its absence, and the various forms it takes.

                  A huge inspiration for this project was my sister Patrisia, who taught me so much about love: caring for those we cherish, standing up for the rights of others, being authentic, and embracing vulnerability. Her life and legacy remind me of the immense power of love and the importance of sharing it.
                  
                  I wanted to create a platform that could make the world a little better by creating an archive of love and inviting people from all walks of life to share their experiences. The power of love is immense, and this project aims to explore and celebrate that higher power.</p>

These include expanding our presence on social media to reach a wider audience, launching a podcast to interview people about various love themes and share their stories, and collaborating with artists to create original content. Additionally, we aim to generate funds to support community initiatives, adopt a pug, and engage in collaborations with other projects and organizations to promote the message of love and connection.</p>
