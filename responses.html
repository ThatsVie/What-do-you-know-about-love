She told me how safe and protected she feels with me because of my size, how handsome I am, and how much she cherishes our life together. Her words were like a balm to my soul, soothing the insecurities that have plagued me for so long. The beach itself held a special significance that day. My grandmother, who passed away recently, had always been afraid of water. I thought about her and also about my brother, who drowned when we were kids. Standing by the water, I felt a profound connection to my ancestors who perished in the ocean's depths. In my grief for my grandmother and the memories of my brother, I felt an overwhelming surge of God's love. Despite all the pain and suffering in the world, I feel blessed to be alive, to have a loving home, a devoted wife, and a strong body that has carried me through so much. It was in that moment, surrounded by the vastness of the ocean, the greatness of God, and the warmth of my wife's love, that I truly felt the most loved."></p>

            <p class="card-text" data-full-text="My spirituality and religious beliefs have been a journey from fear to love. Growing up in Texas, I was taught about a punishing God, one who didn't accept or love me because of my transness. This upbringing filled me with shame and fear, making me feel unworthy of love. Since I began transitioning, I've been on a path of unlearning that doctrine and cultivating a relationship with a loving God.
            It's been a challenging journey, but I've come to understand that true love is not about condemnation but about acceptance and compassion. This new understanding of a loving God gives me hope that love is available to me just as I am. I've learned that spirituality doesn't have to be tied to the harsh judgments I grew up with. Instead, it's about finding peace and love within myself and with those around me.
            While the church wasn't always a loving place for me, I've found love and acceptance in other communities. My friends in the gaming community and my trans support group have shown me what true, unconditional love looks like. Their support and kindness have been instrumental in helping me redefine my spirituality and embrace a God who loves me for who I am. This evolving belief in a loving God influences my understanding of love by reminding me that I am deserving of it, and that love is about acceptance, support, and compassion."></p>

            <h3 class="card-title mt-3">What do you know about love?</h3>
            <p class="card-text" data-full-text="What do I know about love? Honestly, not much, at least not the kind of love that's healthy and nurturing. Growing up love seemed more like a transaction, something you had to earn by sacrificing parts of yourself. My relationships with men were always about doing whatever it took to make them stay, even if it meant losing myself in the process. But they always left anyway, and I was left feeling empty and used.
            My mother was the same. I watched her date abusive men who took advantage of her, and in turn, she neglected me. I never felt like I was enough or deserving of real love. But now, as a new mom, things are starting to change. The father of my child is incarcerated, and I wasn't planning on raising my baby alone. My mother, despite our troubled past, has moved in to help me. She's sharing more about herself, her own struggles and regrets, and we're slowly building a new relationship.
            I’m learning that love isn’t about sacrificing yourself for someone else. It’s about being there, truly being present and supportive. I don’t want my child to grow up with the same patterns I did. I want her to know unconditional love, the kind that doesn’t come with strings attached or a fear of being left behind. I'm still figuring it out, but I know that real love should make you feel safe, valued, and understood. That's the kind of love I want to give my child, and maybe one day, I’ll fully understand and feel it for myself too."></p>

            <h3 class="card-title mt-3">How have your experiences of love evolved over time?</h3>
            <p class="card-text" data-full-text="Love has become much simpler for me as I've aged. I used to think love was all about the grand gestures, the excitement, the passion. I made a lot of mistakes chasing those fleeting moments, and in the process, I caused harm to my children and was harmed by my husbands. Love seemed so complicated back then, and I often lost myself trying to keep up with what I thought love should be.
            Now I realize that love is much simpler than I ever understood. It’s about being present, truly being there for the people you care about. Be here now. Always. Over and over. Don’t bend over backwards too much. Don’t lie. Don’t cheat. Be honest. Keep it simple. Life is already complicated enough.
            I’ve learned to value honesty and consistency over anything else. I've made amends for the harm I've caused and I strive to do better every day. I’m grateful for my age because it has given me the perspective to not care as much about what other people think. I focus on being myself and being true to those I love. When you make mistakes, you make amends and you don't repeat them. That’s the essence of love for me now. It’s about being genuine, being accountable, and being present. Love is simple if you let it be."></p>

Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who uplift you, and engage in activities that bring you joy. Doing things you love will make you happier and more fulfilled. Open up and be vulnerable, allowing others to see and love the real you. If you're struggling with feelings of unworthiness or past traumas, consider seeking help from a therapist, as professional guidance can help you work through issues that may be blocking you from experiencing love."></p>

Before transitioning, I was a conventionally attractive girl who sought attention and affection through sex. I often dissociated due to trauma and dysphoria. Self-love back then revolved around buying things and external validation. Starting HRT brought significant changes, including weight gain and hair loss. This forced me to reevaluate my sense of self and focus on internal respect rather than external appearances. Treating myself with respect gradually turned into genuine self-love, focusing on who I am as a person rather than how I look. I am still learning to love my new body, I am happier than ever, embracing my identity and valuing myself."></p>

For me this practice has become a part of my journey of self acceptance and self love. I have an altar for my grandmother and aunt, who both played significant roles in my life. Before my grandmother passed away, she told me she loved me no matter what, which meant a lot to me because my family does not support me being a lesbian. Before my aunt passed away she confided that she too loved women but was never free to live her truth because of our culture and the time period she grew up in. I light candles for them, place rum, coffee, candy and flowers on the altar, and talk to their presence about the women I am interested in and the dates I go on. This practice is not just about honoring their memory, but also about embracing and accepting my own sexuality. It’s a way for me to feel connected to them and to draw strength from their love and acceptance. This altar is personal and may not be a widely recognized cultural practice related to love, it is important to me as a way to grow the spirit of love and acceptance within my family and my heritage."></p>

I Meet People On Apps And It’s Always About Sex Which Is Fine But After A While I Feel Used. Everyone I Meet Seems Okay At First But Within A Short Time I Find Out They Are Actually Unstable. We Post Pictures Of Our Best Moments But Really Everyone Is Suffering And None Of It Matters. I Feel Hopeless About The Future, I Can’t Imagine Having A Family.

This conflict has made my journey in understanding love more complex. I strive to honor my cultural values, but I also find myself navigating the tension between adhering to tradition and forging my unique path in expressing love."></p>
