That means knowing and accepting the entire person, even with all of their faults or mistakes. It means you won't give up on them or stop loving them no matter what, because we are all humans, and we all have our flaws and make mistakes. I have experienced it and I experience it now, with my partner. Even though he has seen me at my absolute lowest, he accepts it, seeks to understand it, empathizes with me, and loves me anyway.</p>

            <p class="card-text flex-grow-1">Healing from a broken heart is a gradual process for me. I allow myself to feel and process the emotions rather than suppressing them. I lean on my support system, my friends and family, who remind me of my worth and keep me company. Engaging in activities I love, like painting and hiking, also helps me find joy and distraction. I practice self-compassion, reminding myself that it's okay to take time to heal and that it's a part of life.</p>

            <p class="card-text flex-grow-1">I've learned that love, even when it ends in heartbreak, is worth experiencing. It teaches us resilience and the capacity to deeply connect with others. Heartbreak has shown me the importance of cherishing moments and expressing love openly. It's also taught me the value of self-love and finding strength within myself. Healing comes with time, and with it, a renewed appreciation for the beauty of love and life.</p>

She went beyond her job to show me support and kindness. She would get me clothes that I actually liked and matched my style making me feel seen and understood in a way I hadn't felt before. She got me books and recommended movies that broadened my understanding of the world and showed me that there was more to life than what I had known. She also encouraged me to pursue becoming a barber, recognizing my potential and passion. She made me feel valued and loved for the first time in my life.</p>

            <p class="card-text flex-grow-1">Unconditional love means a bond that transcends circumstances, faults, and failures. It’s a love that remains steadfast and unwavering no matter what happens. I have never felt this kind of love from another person, but I have experienced it with my service dog, Patrick. Patrick has been my constant companion, and his love for me is pure and unconditional. He knows when I’m sad and instinctively knows how to make me feel better. Taking care of him has given me a reason to persevere and has kept me from spiraling into dark depression. Patrick has taught me how to take care of myself better, and even when I don’t have the energy for a long walk, he is just happy to be by my side. His love has shown me what it means to be loved without conditions, and for that, I am deeply grateful.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">When have you felt the most loved?</h5>
            <p class="card-text flex-grow-1">I felt the most loved last weekend at the beach with my wife. It was a day that started like many others, with my usual reluctance to take off my shirt and expose my chest. For years I've struggled with feeling comfortable in my own skin, especially because of my size. But my wife, my incredible partner, reminded me just how much she loves every part of me. She told me how safe and protected she feels with me because of my size, how handsome I am, and how much she cherishes our life together. Her words were like a balm to my soul, soothing the insecurities that have plagued me for so long.
              <br>
              <br>The beach itself held a special significance that day. My grandmother, who passed away recently, had always been afraid of water. I thought about her and also about my brother, who drowned when we were kids. Standing by the water, I felt a profound connection to my ancestors who perished in the ocean's depths. In my grief for my grandmother and the memories of my brother, I felt an overwhelming surge of God's love. Despite all the pain and suffering in the world, I feel blessed to be alive, to have a loving home, a devoted wife, and a strong body that has carried me through so much. It was in that moment, surrounded by the vastness of the ocean, the greatness of God, and the warmth of my wife's love, that I truly felt the most loved.

            <h5 class="card-title">How does your spirituality or religious beliefs influence your understanding of love?</h5>
            <p class="card-text flex-grow-1">My spirituality and religious beliefs have been a journey from fear to love. Growing up in Texas, I was taught about a punishing God, one who didn't accept or love me because of my transness. This upbringing filled me with shame and fear, making me feel unworthy of love. Since I began transitioning, I've been on a path of unlearning that doctrine and cultivating a relationship with a loving God. <br> <br>
              It's been a challenging journey, but I've come to understand that true love is not about condemnation but about acceptance and compassion. This new understanding of a loving God gives me hope that love is available to me just as I am. I've learned that spirituality doesn't have to be tied to the harsh judgments I grew up with. Instead, it's about finding peace and love within myself and with those around me.<br> <br>
              While the church wasn't always a loving place for me, I've found love and acceptance in other communities. My friends in the gaming community and my trans support group have shown me what true, unconditional love looks like. Their support and kindness have been instrumental in helping me redefine my spirituality and embrace a God who loves me for who I am. This evolving belief in a loving God influences my understanding of love by reminding me that I am deserving of it, and that love is about acceptance, support, and compassion.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Do you believe in a spiritual or higher form of love? If so, how do you experience it?</h5>
            <p class="card-text flex-grow-1">My journey through recovery has taught me a lot about love and a higher power. As part of a 12-step program, I’ve come to understand God in my own way, which I choose to call Love. The love I feel from the fellowship, the support and understanding from others who have walked similar paths, and the love I feel from simple things like the sun rising and setting each day all of this is proof of God's presence for me. <br> <br>
              Despite surviving so many horrible experiences in active addiction, I am still here, still standing. That in itself is a testament to something bigger than myself. I've learned that things always seem to work out in the end, not because I'm so great or lucky, but because of this greater love that holds me. It's a humbling realization that something greater than me loves me, and that love has carried me through my darkest times.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">What do you know about love?</h5>
            <p class="card-text flex-grow-1">What do I know about love? Honestly, not much, at least not the kind of love that's healthy and nurturing. Growing up love seemed more like a transaction, something you had to earn by sacrificing parts of yourself. My relationships with men were always about doing whatever it took to make them stay, even if it meant losing myself in the process. But they always left anyway, and I was left feeling empty and used. <br> <br>
              My mother was the same. I watched her date abusive men who took advantage of her, and in turn, she neglected me. I never felt like I was enough or deserving of real love. But now, as a new mom, things are starting to change. The father of my child is incarcerated, and I wasn't planning on raising my baby alone. My mother, despite our troubled past, has moved in to help me. She's sharing more about herself, her own struggles and regrets, and we're slowly building a new relationship.<br> <br>
              I’m learning that love isn’t about sacrificing yourself for someone else. It’s about being there, truly being present and supportive. I don’t want my child to grow up with the same patterns I did. I want her to know unconditional love, the kind that doesn’t come with strings attached or a fear of being left behind. I'm still figuring it out, but I know that real love should make you feel safe, valued, and understood. That's the kind of love I want to give my child, and maybe one day, I’ll fully understand and feel it for myself too.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">How have your experiences of love evolved over time?</h5>
            <p class="card-text flex-grow-1">Love has become much simpler for me as I've aged. I used to think love was all about the grand gestures, the excitement, the passion. I made a lot of mistakes chasing those fleeting moments, and in the process, I caused harm to my children and was harmed by my husbands. Love seemed so complicated back then, and I often lost myself trying to keep up with what I thought love should be. <br> <br>
              Now I realize that love is much simpler than I ever understood. It’s about being present, truly being there for the people you care about. Be here now. Always. Over and over. Don’t bend over backwards too much. Don’t lie. Don’t cheat. Be honest. Keep it simple. Life is already complicated enough.<br> <br>
              I’ve learned to value honesty and consistency over anything else. I've made amends for the harm I've caused and I strive to do better every day. I’m grateful for my age because it has given me the perspective to not care as much about what other people think. I focus on being myself and being true to those I love. When you make mistakes, you make amends and you don't repeat them. That’s the essence of love for me now. It’s about being genuine, being accountable, and being present. Love is simple if you let it be.</p>

            <p class="card-text flex-grow-1">The most powerful lesson love has taught me is the strength found in patience and resilience. My relationship with T and A has shown me the depths of understanding and support that love can provide, even when the world seems against us. Love has taught me to embrace the complexities of life, whether it's fighting for disability rights, racial equality, or queer rights. Our love feels radical and political, and though my family doesn't support our choices, the unwavering support of my friends keeps me grounded. Caring for A and pursuing my dreams of becoming a therapist have taught me that love is about dedication, empathy, and the courage to stand by those you care for, no matter the challenges. Love has made me stronger and more compassionate, and it's shown me that true love is a powerful force for change and growth.</p>

I realized that the right person will appreciate me for who I am. Meeting David, who understands and accepts me, has taught me that past pain and loss were part of my journey towards self-acceptance and finding true love. Now I know that being myself is enough and that the right person will come along who values and understands me.</p>

            <p class="card-text flex-grow-1">Finding love can sometimes feel elusive, especially when you're struggling to feel it within yourself. Start by focusing on self-love, embracing your unique qualities, and practicing self-compassion. Understand your worth and radiate that confidence outward. Be patient, as love often arrives when you least expect it, and trust that it will find you when the time is right. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who uplift you, and engage in activities that bring you joy. Doing things you love will make you happier and more fulfilled. Open up and be vulnerable, allowing others to see and love the real you. If you're struggling with feelings of unworthiness or past traumas, consider seeking help from a therapist, as professional guidance can help you work through issues that may be blocking you from experiencing love.</p>
