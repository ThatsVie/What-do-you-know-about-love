## Project Overview

_What Do You Know About Love?_ is a digital platform exploring love through personal reflections and AI-generated imagery. By pairing deeply human stories with AI visuals, this project challenges assumptions about art, emotion, and authenticity while inviting contributors and audiences to reconsider how love is expressed, perceived, and reimagined in a rapidly evolving world.

Participants select a question about love, submit their response, and have their words transformed into response cards accompanied by AI-generated visuals. The website serves as an evolving interactive archive, amplifying perspectives that highlight the many forms and expressions of love.

## Features and Functionality

### Interactive Response Cards

- Responses are transformed into readable cards that preserve contributor anonymity (if chosen) while adding visual depth to each story.

### Search and Navigation

- Users can search through responses by **keywords** or by selecting **specific questions**.
- **Smooth Scrolling & Back to Top Navigation** for a seamless browsing experience.

### Question Links and Dynamic Content Loading

- Clicking on any **question category** loads related responses, creating an intuitive way to explore content.

---

## Submission Management and Processing

_What Do You Know About Love?_ employs a **semi-automated workflow** to collect, process, and publish submissions:

- **Google Forms**: Securely collects user responses while allowing contributors to remain anonymous.
- **Google Sheets**: Stores and organizes submissions for review.
- **Google Apps Script & Manual Curation**: A combination of automation and human review ensures thoughtful formatting, accessibility, and ethical considerations before a submission is published.

---

## Imagery and Visuals

This project uses **AI-generated images from DALL-E** to visually accompany human reflections on love. The choice to use AI is **deliberate**, highlighting the contrast between emotion and automation, storytelling and simulation.

While AI cannot feel love, it can serve as a visual reflection of human narratives, sparking further dialogue on how technology influences our perceptions of love and connection.

---

## Ethical Considerations and Transparency

_What Do You Know About Love?_ actively engages with the **ethical implications** of using AI in storytelling and representation:

- This project **does not replace human artistry** with AI but instead uses it as a way to **highlight the complexities of love in a digital age**.
- All identifiers are **optional**, and contributors can **choose to remain anonymous**.
- Each response card includes **alt text**, and **image descriptions** are provided on Instagram to ensure inclusivity.

This project exists not to provide a single definition of love but to create a space for multiple truths and perspectives.

---

## Challenges and Reflections

Creating _What Do You Know About Love?_ has required balancing:

- **Automation vs. Personalization**: While Google Apps Script helps automate aspects of the submission process, manual curation remains essential to ensure each story is handled with care.
- **AI Ethics**: The project continuously evolves with ethical considerations in mind, and future updates may explore alternative ways to represent submissions visually.
- **Sustaining Engagement**: Building a growing, engaged community while maintaining quality storytelling is an ongoing challenge, but one that fuels this project‚Äôs mission.
