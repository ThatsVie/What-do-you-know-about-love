## Submission Management and Processing

The project uses a combination of Google Forms, Google Sheets, and Google Apps Script to manage and process submissions:

- **Google Forms**: Collects user responses in a secure and user-friendly manner.

- **Google Sheets**: Stores the responses, acting as the database for the project.

- **Google Apps Script**: Partially automates the creation of response cards based on the submissions, reducing manual work and ensuring consistency. Manual steps are still taken to add images, alt text, and tags for accessibility.

This approach balances automation with manual oversight, maintaining the quality and personalization of each response card. As the project grows, additional tools may be considered to handle increased demands.
