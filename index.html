She patiently showed me how to make clothes, mend, measure, and work with different fabrics. Her sewing room was filled with colorful threads, needles, fabrics, and a dress form I loved playing with. It became my sanctuary. I make a living creating custom pieces for others and I honor her legacy by sharing that love with my clients. I talk about her every day and feel her love with me always."

I celebrate love in my daily life by cherishing their presence and challenging the common misconceptions about rats. Many people don't realize how social and intelligent rats are. They form strong bonds, recognize their names, and enjoy interacting with me and each other. My daily routine of caring for them, playing with them, and appreciating their unique personalities is my way of honoring and celebrating the love we share. Love comes in many forms and I've found it in the companionship of my rats."

For years I've struggled with feeling comfortable in my own skin, especially because of my size. But my wife, my incredible partner, reminded me just how much she loves every part of me. She told me how safe and protected she feels with me because of my size, how handsome I am, and how much she loves our life together. Her words were like a balm to my soul, soothing the insecurities that have plagued me for so long. The beach itself held a special significance that day. My grandmother, who passed away recently, had always been afraid of water. I thought about her and also about my brother, who drowned when we were kids. Standing by the water, I felt a profound connection to my ancestors who perished in the ocean's depths. In my grief for my grandmother and the memories of my brother, I felt an overwhelming surge of God's love. Despite all the pain and suffering in the world, I feel blessed to be alive, to have a loving home, a devoted wife, and a strong body that has carried me through so much. It was in that moment, surrounded by the vastness of the ocean, the greatness of God, and the warmth of my wife's love, that I truly felt the most loved."
