              <p class="card-text" data-full-text="I’m a Leo, and I dated a Leo. She was so evolved and had all the traits I was immature about in a more mature way. While I sought attention through loud behavior and struggled with ego driven conflicts, she embodied the higher vibration of Leo energy, confidence without arrogance, generosity without expectation, and loyalty with compassion. She drew people in with her warm presence and handled conflicts with grace and understanding. Watching her lead by example, using our natural Leo charisma to inspire others, taught me the true meaning of selfless love. This relationship transformed my understanding of love, showing me that it's about growth, self-improvement, and everyday acts of kindness and support, not just grand gestures. Although we are no longer together, it was the first relationship that ended on good terms. Love, at its highest vibration, is a journey of mutual growth and enlightenment, embracing strengths and working on weaknesses together."></p>

              <h3 class="card-title mt-3">What do you know about love?</h3>
              <p class="card-text" data-full-text="What do I know about love? Honestly, not much, at least not the kind of love that's healthy and nurturing. Growing up love seemed more like a transaction, something you had to earn by sacrificing parts of yourself. My relationships with men were always about doing whatever it took to make them stay, even if it meant losing myself in the process. But they always left anyway, and I was left feeling empty and used.
            My mother was the same. I watched her date abusive men who took advantage of her, and in turn, she neglected me. I never felt like I was enough or deserving of real love. But now that I'm a mom things are starting to change. The father of my child is incarcerated, and I wasn't planning on raising my baby alone. My mother, despite our troubled past, has moved in to help me. She's sharing more about herself, her own struggles and regrets, and we're slowly building a new relationship.
            I’m learning that love isn’t about sacrificing yourself for someone else. It’s about being there, truly being present and supportive. I don’t want my child to grow up with the same patterns I did. I want her to know unconditional love, the kind that doesn’t come with strings attached or a fear of being left behind. I'm still figuring it out, but I know that real love should make you feel safe, valued, and understood. That's the kind of love I want to give my child, and maybe one day, I’ll fully understand and feel it for myself too."></p>

              <p class="card-text" data-full-text="Unconditional love to me is, quite literally, loving without conditions. That means knowing and accepting the entire person, even with all of their faults or mistakes. It means you won't give up on them or stop loving them no matter what, because we are all humans, and we all have our flaws and make mistakes. I have experienced it and I experience it now, with my partner. Even though he has seen me at my absolute lowest, he accepts it, seeks to understand it, empathizes with me, and loves me anyway."></p>

I find myself contemplating over my life, where I've been, how far I've come and more than anything else how loved I’ve been in this life.  I’m reminded of the poem  “Thank God For Dirty Dishes”
        By Mary Arlis Stuber
        “Thank God for dirty dishes;
        They have a tale to tell.
        While others may go hungry,
        We’re eating very well
        With home, health, and happiness,
        I shouldn’t want to fuss;
        By the stack of evidence,
        God’s been very good to us.”"></p>
