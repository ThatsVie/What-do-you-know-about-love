I Meet People On Apps And It’s Always About Sex Which Is Fine But After A While I Feel Used. Everyone I Meet Seems Okay At First But Within A Short Time I Find Out They Are Actually Unstable. We Post Pictures Of Our Best Moments But Really Everyone Is Suffering And None Of It Matters. I Feel Hopeless About The Future, I Can’t Imagine Having A Family.

I celebrate love in my daily life by cherishing their presence and challenging the common misconceptions about rats. Many people don't realize how social and intelligent rats are. They form strong bonds, recognize their names, and enjoy interacting with me and each other. My daily routine of caring for them, playing with them, and appreciating their unique personalities is my way of honoring and celebrating the love we share. Love comes in many forms and I've found it in the companionship of my rats."

Recently, we started doing video calls more and I’ve found myself looking back at pictures of us as kids. It reminds me of the love and sense of belonging I felt then, and it keeps that love alive today. In many ways we’re still those little boys inside standing on the corner, connected by the bond we formed back then.
