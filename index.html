She got me books and recommended movies that broadened my understanding of the world and showed me that there was more to life than the abuse I had known. She also encouraged me to pursue becoming a barber, recognizing my potential and passion. She made me feel valued and loved for the first time in my life."></p>

              <p class="card-text" data-full-text="I felt the most loved last weekend at the beach with my wife. It was a day that started like many others, with my usual reluctance to take off my shirt and expose my chest. For years I've struggled with feeling comfortable in my own skin, especially because of my size. But my wife, my incredible partner, reminded me just how much she loves every part of me. She told me how safe and protected she feels with me because of my size, how handsome I am, and how much she loves our life together. Her words were like a balm to my soul, soothing the insecurities that have plagued me for so long. The beach itself held a special significance that day. My grandmother, who passed away recently, had always been afraid of water. I thought about her and also about my brother, who drowned when we were kids. Standing by the water, I felt a profound connection to my ancestors who perished in the ocean's depths. In my grief for my grandmother and the memories of my brother, I felt an overwhelming surge of God's love. Despite all the pain and suffering in the world, I feel blessed to be alive, to have a loving home, a devoted wife, and a strong body that has carried me through so much. It was in that moment, surrounded by the vastness of the ocean, the greatness of God, and the warmth of my wife's love, that I truly felt the most loved."></p>

              <p class="card-text" data-full-text="Unconditional love to me is, quite literally, loving without conditions. That means knowing and accepting the entire person, even with all of their faults or mistakes. It means you won't give up on them or stop loving them no matter what, because we are all humans, and we all have our flaws and make mistakes. I have experienced it and I experience it now, with my partner. Even though he has seen me at my absolute lowest, he accepts it, seeks to understand it, empathizes with me, and loves me anyway."></p>

                During our walks, we discuss our plans for the day, share our feelings, and simply enjoy each other's company. We take time to notice our surroundings, greet neighbors we encounter, and appreciate the weather. This daily ritual strengthens our bond and sets a positive tone for the rest of our day."></p>
