              <h3 class="card-title mt-3">What lessons have you learned from experiencing heartbreak or loss in love?</h3>
              <p class="card-text flex-grow-1">Heartbreak and loss have been tough for me. For a long time I felt like a disappointment and struggled to connect with others. Being rejected after dates left me feeling lost and questioning my worth. Over time, though, I've learned that it's okay to be myself and that I don't have to be right for everyone. I realized that the right person will appreciate me for who I am. Meeting David, who understands and accepts me, has taught me that past pain and loss were part of my journey towards self-acceptance and finding true love. Now I know that being myself is enough and that the right person will come along who values and understands me.</p>

              <p class="card-text flex-grow-1">To me, love feels like safety. It feels like being able to be completely vulnerable with your partner without judgement. It feels like a warm hug when you're really sad.</p>
