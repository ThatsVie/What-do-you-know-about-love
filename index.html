              <h3 class="card-title mt-3">How does your spirituality or religious beliefs influence your understanding of love?</h3>
              <p class="card-text" data-full-text="My spirituality and religious beliefs have been a journey from fear to love. Growing up in Texas, I was taught about a punishing God, one who didn't accept or love me because of my transness. This upbringing filled me with shame and fear, making me feel unworthy of love. Since I began transitioning, I've been on a path of unlearning that doctrine and cultivating a relationship with a loving God.
            It's been a challenging journey, but I've come to understand that true love is not about condemnation but about acceptance and compassion. This new understanding of a loving God gives me hope that love is available to me just as I am. I've learned that spirituality doesn't have to be tied to the harsh judgments I grew up with. Instead, it's about finding peace and love within myself and with those around me.
            While the church wasn't always a loving place for me, I've found love and acceptance in other communities. My friends in the gaming community and my trans support group have shown me what true, unconditional love looks like. Their support and kindness have been instrumental in helping me redefine my spirituality and embrace a God who loves me for who I am. This evolving belief in a loving God influences my understanding of love by reminding me that I am deserving of it, and that love is about acceptance, support, and compassion."></p>

              <h3 class="card-title mt-3">How has a significant relationship changed your understanding of love?</h3>
              <p class="card-text" data-full-text="I’m a Leo, and I dated a Leo. She was so evolved and had all the traits I was immature about in a more mature way. While I sought attention through loud behavior and struggled with ego driven conflicts, she embodied the higher vibration of Leo energy, confidence without arrogance, generosity without expectation, and loyalty with compassion. She drew people in with her warm presence and handled conflicts with grace and understanding. Watching her lead by example, using our natural Leo charisma to inspire others, taught me the true meaning of selfless love. This relationship transformed my understanding of love, showing me that it's about growth, self-improvement, and everyday acts of kindness and support, not just grand gestures. Although we are no longer together, it was the first relationship that ended on good terms. Love, at its highest vibration, is a journey of mutual growth and enlightenment, embracing strengths and working on weaknesses together."></p>

              <p class="card-text" data-full-text="Unconditional love to me is, quite literally, loving without conditions. That means knowing and accepting the entire person, even with all of their faults or mistakes. It means you won't give up on them or stop loving them no matter what, because we are all humans, and we all have our flaws and make mistakes. I have experienced it and I experience it now, with my partner. Even though he has seen me at my absolute lowest, he accepts it, seeks to understand it, empathizes with me, and loves me anyway."></p>

                During our walks, we discuss our plans for the day, share our feelings, and simply enjoy each other's company. We take time to notice our surroundings, greet neighbors we encounter, and appreciate the weather. This daily ritual strengthens our bond and sets a positive tone for the rest of our day."></p>

Being rejected after dates left me feeling lost and questioning my worth. Over time, though, I've learned that it's okay to be myself and that I don't have to be right for everyone. I realized that the right person will appreciate me for who I am. Meeting David, who understands and accepts me, has taught me that past pain and loss were part of my journey towards self-acceptance and finding true love. Now I know that being myself is enough and that the right person will come along who values and understands me."></p>
